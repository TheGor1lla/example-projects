# Example Project

This is an example project to show how to 
develop an application in the the **development** profile.

```yaml
coffeenet:
  profile: development
```

In this profile all external dependencies 
like the auth or the discovery server are mocked.

There are default users, if you have added the 
sso starter, described in [the coffeenet-starter-sso documentation](https://github.com/coffeenet/coffeenet-starter/tree/master/coffeenet-starter-sso)
