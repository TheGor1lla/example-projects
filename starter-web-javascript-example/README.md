# Starter Web JavaScript Example Project

This is an example project to show the behaviour
of the web javascript starter.

The web javascript starter is designed to provide
the CoffeeNet navigation bar with anchor points for
an easy integration of

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>coffee.synyx</groupId>
    <artifactId>starter-discovery</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

and

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>coffee.synyx</groupId>
    <artifactId>starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The navigation bar is designed to be enriched
by these dependencies. Just add one of these
dependencies and restart the application.

If you use the security starter e.g. your profile
will be rendered and a logout button will appear.
